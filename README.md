## Maniac Music Project
> This is the backend repository for Ava and Alexa Carlson's APCSP project.
- Known as "The Carlson Twins" or "X and V" (thank you Mr. Mortensen), we are a power duo that kind of enjoys computer science.
- This project focuses on music. Users are able to add their favorite songs at the moment and look for concerts, comedy shows, and sports games. Users are also able to log into their Spotify to access what playlists and songs they have.

### [Deployed Backend](http://maniacmusic.duckdns.org/)
### [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/avac54765/ManiacMusic) and [Deplpoyed Site](https://avac54765.github.io/ManiacMusic/)

Both of the repositories are templates, so feel free to use the templates to create your own repositories with our code. 
This repository contains edits of the flask_portfolio repository from nighthawkcoders.

Clone both repositories to get the full Carlson experience of full stack.
